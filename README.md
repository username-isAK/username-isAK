## 👨‍💻 Hi, I’m Abhishek

I’m interested in **full-stack development** and **DevOps**, and I enjoy understanding how applications work end-to-end — from designing backend APIs and building frontend interfaces to learning how systems are deployed and run in real environments.

Lately, I’ve been exploring **AI agents**, focusing on how autonomous programs can observe changes, make decisions, and trigger actions. Learning to combine LLMs with tools like web automation, scheduling, and notifications.Alongside this, I’m learning **Next.js**, **Linux fundamentals**, **cloud basics (AWS)**, and **Docker** to understand how modern applications are built and prepared for production.


### 💻 Currently Working With

**Frontend:** React.js, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap  
**Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, REST APIs  
**Database:** MongoDB, MySQL  
**DevOps / Infra (learning):** Docker, Linux basics, AWS fundamentals  
**Programming & Tools:** JavaScript, Python, Git
