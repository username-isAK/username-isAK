# 👨‍💻 Hi, I’m Abhishek

I’m an aspiring **full-stack developer** with a strong interest in **DevOps**, focused on building end-to-end web applications and understanding how systems work beyond just writing code.

I enjoy designing backend APIs, building frontend interfaces, and learning how applications are prepared, deployed, and run in real-world environments. Recently, I’ve been exploring **AI agents**, working on autonomous programs that monitor changes, make decisions, and trigger actions by combining LLMs with tools such as web automation, scheduling, and notifications.

I’m actively building projects using **React**, **Node.js**, and **databases**, while strengthening my fundamentals in **Next.js**, **Linux**, **Docker**, and **AWS basics** to move towards production-ready systems.
