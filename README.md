## 👨‍💻 Hi, I am Abhishek

I’m interested in full-stack development and DevOps, and I enjoy understanding how applications work end-to-end — from designing backend APIs and building frontend interfaces to deploying and running systems in real environments.

Lately, I’ve been exploring **AI agents**, especially how autonomous programs can observe changes, make decisions, and trigger actions without constant human input. I’m learning how to combine LLMs with tools like web automation, data extraction, scheduling, and notifications to build practical agents that monitor systems, process information, and respond intelligently. Alongside this, I’m learning Next.js, Linux fundamentals, and Docker to better understand how such systems can be deployed and maintained in production.
