## 👨‍💻 Hi, I’m Abhishek

I’m passionate about **full-stack development** and **DevOps**, building end-to-end applications from backend APIs to frontend interfaces, and deploying them in real environments.  

I’m also exploring **AI agents** — autonomous programs that monitor systems, process information, and trigger actions. I’m learning how to combine LLMs with tools like tools like web automation, scheduling, and notifications. Alongside this, I’m building knowledge of **Next.js**, **Linux fundamentals**, **AWS fundamentals**, and **Docker** to build and maintain production-ready systems.
